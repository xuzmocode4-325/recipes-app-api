# Recipe App API


## Dockerfile Specs:
*   `FROM python:3.13-alpine3.21` -  This instruction sets the base image for the Docker image to `python:3.13-alpine3.21`. This image is a lightweight Linux distribution based on Alpine Linux, with Python 3.13 pre-installed.
*   `LABEL maintainer="xuzmonomi.com"` - This adds metadata to the image, indicating that "xuzmonomi.com" is the maintainer of this image.
*   `ENV PYTHONBUFFERED=1` - This sets an environment variable `PYTHONBUFFERED` to `1`.  This ensures that the Python output is not buffered, which is useful for seeing logs in real-time.
*   `COPY ./requirements.txt /tmp/requirments.txt` - This instruction copies the `requirements.txt` file from the current directory (`./`) on the host to the `/tmp/requirments.txt` directory in the Docker image. This file likely contains a list of Python dependencies for the application.
*   `COPY ./requirements.dev.txt /tmp/requirements.dev.txt` - This copies the `requirements.dev.txt` file from the local directory to the `/tmp` directory in the Docker image. This file likely contains development-related Python dependencies.
*   `COPY ./app /app`[5] - This copies the entire `./app` directory from the host machine to the `/app` directory within the Docker image. This directory likely contains the application's source code.
*   `WORKDIR /app` - This sets the working directory for any subsequent `RUN`, `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`, `COPY`, and `ADD` instructions to `/app`. This means that commands will be executed from within this directory.
*   `EXPOSE 8000` - This exposes port 8000 on the container, making it accessible from the outside. However, it doesn't publish the port, which requires using the `-p` flag when running the container.
*   `ARG DEV=false` -  This defines a build-time argument named `DEV` and sets its default value to `false`. This argument can be used to conditionally execute commands during the image build process.
*   `RUN python -m venv /py && \ /py/bin/pip install --upgrade pip && \ apk add --update --no-cache postgresql-client && \ apk add --update --no-cache --virtual .tmp-build-deps \ build-base postgresql-dev musl-dev && \ /py/bin/pip install -r /tmp/requirments.txt && \ if [ $DEV = "true" ]; \ then /py/bin/pip install -r /tmp/requirements.dev.txt ; \ fi && \ rm -rf /tmp && \ apk del .tmp-build-deps && \ adduser \ --disabled-password \ --no-create-home \ app-user` - This `RUN` instruction executes a series of commands:
    *   `python -m venv /py` - Creates a Python virtual environment in the `/py` directory.
    *   `/py/bin/pip install --upgrade pip` -  Upgrades `pip` to the latest version within the virtual environment.
    *   `apk add --update --no-cache postgresql-client` - Installs the `postgresql-client` package using Alpine's package manager (`apk`). The `--no-cache` flag prevents caching the package, reducing the image size.
    *   `apk add --update --no-cache --virtual .tmp-build-deps build-base postgresql-dev musl-dev` - Installs build dependencies required for compiling Python packages with native extensions. The `--virtual .tmp-build-deps` creates a temporary installation environment named `.tmp-build-deps`.
    *   `/py/bin/pip install -r /tmp/requirments.txt` - Installs Python dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file within the virtual environment.
    *   `if [ $DEV = "true" ]; then /py/bin/pip install -r /tmp/requirements.dev.txt ; fi` - Conditionally installs development dependencies from `requirements.dev.txt` if the `DEV` argument is set to `"true"`.
    *   `rm -rf /tmp` - Removes the `/tmp` directory to clean up temporary files and reduce the image size.
    *   `apk del .tmp-build-deps` - Removes the temporary build dependencies installed earlier.
    *   `adduser --disabled-password --no-create-home app-user` - Adds a new user named `app-user` with a disabled password and without creating a home directory.
*   `ENV PATH="/py/bin:$PATH"` - This sets the `PATH` environment variable to include the virtual environment's binary directory (`/py/bin`), ensuring that the Python interpreter and other tools installed in the virtual environment are accessible.
*   `USER app-user` -  This specifies that the container should run as the `app-user` user, which improves security by preventing the application from running as the root user.


## Docker Compose Configs
A `docker-compose.yml` file is used to define and manage multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to configure application services using YAML rules. Here's an explanation of the provided `docker-compose.yml` file:

*   **`services`**: This section defines the different containers (services) that make up the application[1].

    *   **`app`**: This service represents the main application container.
        *   **`build`**: Specifies how to build the image for this service.
            *   **`context: .`**: Sets the build context to the current directory, meaning the Dockerfile (if used) and other necessary files are located here.
            *   **`args`**: Defines build-time arguments.
                *   `- DEV=true`: Sets the `DEV` argument to `true` during the build process. This is used to conditionally execute commands in the Dockerfile, to install development dependencies or configure the application for development mode.
        *   **`ports`**: Exposes port 8000 on the container to port 8000 on the host machine, making the application accessible from outside the Docker network.
            *   `- "8000:8000"`
        *   **`volumes`**: Defines volume mappings between the host and the container.
            *   `- "./app:/app"`: Mounts the `./app` directory on the host to the `/app` directory in the container. This allows code changes on the host to be reflected inside the container, which is useful for development.
            * `-"dev-static-data:/vol/web"`: Mounts `dev-static-data` volume to the `vol/web` directory in the container so that the data in it can persist data even if the container is removed. The purpose of this volume is to store static data that the application needs to access, such as images, stylesheets, or other assets.
        *   **`command`**: Specifies the command to run when the container starts.
            *   `sh -c "python manage.py wait_for_db && python manage.py migrate && python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000"`: This command executes a shell script that first waits for the database to be available, then applies any pending database migrations, and finally starts the Django development server on host `0.0.0.0` and port `8000`.
        *   **`environment`**: Sets environment variables for the container.
            *   `- DB_HOST=db`: Sets the database host to `db`. Because Docker Compose uses the service names for automatic DNS resolution, `db` will resolve to the database container's IP address[1].
            *   `- DB_NAME=devdb`: Sets the database name to `devdb`.
            *   `- DB_USER=devuser`: Sets the database user to `devuser`.
            *   `- DB_PASS=changeme`: Sets the database password to `changeme`.
        *   **`depends_on`**: Specifies that this service depends on the `db` service.  Docker Compose will start the `db` service before the `app` service.
            *   `- db`
    *   **`db`**: This service represents the PostgreSQL database container.
        *   **`image`**: Uses the `postgres:17.2-alpine3.21` image from Docker Hub, which is a lightweight version of PostgreSQL.
        *   **`volumes`**: Defines volume mappings for the container.
            *   `- dev-db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`: Mounts a named volume `dev-db-data` to the `/var/lib/postgresql/data` directory in the container, which is where PostgreSQL stores its data. This ensures that the database data persists even when the container is stopped or removed.
        *   **`environment`**: Sets environment variables for the container.
            *   `- POSTGRES_DB=devdb`: Sets the database name to `devdb`.
            *   `- POSTGRES_USER=devuser`: Sets the database user to `devuser`.
            *   `- POSTGRES_PASSWORD=changeme`: Sets the database password to `changeme`.
*   **`volumes`**: This section defines the named volumes used by the services.
    *   **`dev-db-data`**: This is a named volume used by the `db` service to persist the database data.  Docker manages the creation and storage of this volume. It is only used in development (hence the name `dev-db-data`), not production. 
    *  **`dev-static`**: This is a named volume used by the `app` service to manage the storage of static and media files during development.  

In summary, this `docker-compose.yml` file defines a multi-container application consisting of an application service (`app`) and a PostgreSQL database service (`db`). The application is configured to connect to the database using environment variables, and the database data is persisted using a named volume. The `DEV=true` argument suggests that this configuration is intended for a development environment[1][2]. Using `docker-compose up`  will start the application and all of its services.


## Linting
Linting is configured through `flake8`, a Python tool that wraps other tools like `pycodestyle`, `pyflakes`, and `mccabe` to enforce coding style and detect errors. It's used to maintain code quality and consistency in Python projects. The `flake 8` package is installed as a dev requirment in the docker image using pip. The configurations for the `flake8` package are stored in the root of the app directory in the `.flake8` file. The configurations for `flake8` are as follows: 

*   `[flake8]`
    *   This section header indicates that the following options are for the `flake8` tool.
*   `exclude =`
    *   This option specifies a comma-separated list of files or directories that `flake8` should ignore during its analysis. In this case, the following are excluded:
        *   `migrations` - This likely refers to a directory containing database migration files. These files are often auto-generated and may not adhere to the same strict style guidelines as application code.
        *   `__pycache__` - This directory is automatically created by Python to store compiled bytecode files. There's no need to lint these.
        *   `manage.py` - This is a Django management script. While it's Python code, it might have specific formatting needs or conventions that differ from the rest of the project, or it might be automatically generated.
        *   `settings.py` - This is a Django settings file. Similar to `manage.py`, it may have specific formatting needs or automatically generated content that you don't want to strictly lint.

In essence, this configuration tells `flake8` to skip checking the style and potential errors in the `migrations` directory, `__pycache__` directories, and the `manage.py` and `settings.py` files. This is a common practice to avoid unnecessary warnings or errors in generated or configuration-specific files, focusing `flake8`'s analysis on the core application code.


## Docker Commands
*   **`docker build .`** - This instruction builds the docker image using the specifications defined in the `Dockerfile`. 

*   **`docker compose run --rm app sh -c "[django_command]"`** - This command runs the docker image and passes in commands to the shell. 

    *    `docker compose`: runs a docker compose command
    *    `run`: starts a specific containder defined in congig
    *    `--rm`: removes the container
    *    `app`: the name of the service
    *    `sh -c`: passes in a shell command

## Testing

*   **`docker compose run --rm app sh -c "python manage.py test"`** - This command runs the docker image and all the tests for each app using Django's built test module. 

## Deployment 
The run.sh file is prepares the application environment and starting the application server.

Deployment is simplified and through the run.sh file, a shell script designed to automate the process of setting up and starting a web application using Django and uWSGI.
